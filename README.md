  <summary>Problem it Solves</summary><br>

1. **Seed Security and Accessibility**: Many small-scale farmers face challenges in accessing quality seeds, especially after a poor harvest or natural disasters. This software provides a structured system for seed storage and distribution, ensuring farmers have access to a diverse range of seeds when needed.
   
2. **Crop Diversification**: By enabling the exchange and withdrawal of different seed varieties, the system encourages crop diversification, which can lead to better pest resistance, improved soil health, and increased resilience to climate change.

3. **Financial Stability**: In times of financial strain, farmers can borrow seeds, which they can repay with seeds from their next harvest. This reduces their dependence on expensive commercial seeds and loans.

4. **Knowledge Sharing**: The platform can serve as a hub for information on organic farming methods, helping farmers adopt sustainable practices that can improve yield and reduce environmental impact.
